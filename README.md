# JDFE_Rshiny_App
An Rshiny app for exploring how the shape of the joint distribution of fitness effects (JDFE) determines the pleiotropic outcomes of evolution. Informed by work presented in Ardell and Kryazhimskiy eLife 2021 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/73250). This is intended for educational purposes. 

You can run this app by opening it in an updated version of RStudio. The relevant packages are listed at the top of the script and will need to be downloaded with 'install.packages()' if they have not already been installed. 

Once the packages are loaded, you can simply press the 'Run App' button in the top right of the console to initiate a session of the app in your browser. 

I hope you have fun exploring the JDFE and pleiotropy!
